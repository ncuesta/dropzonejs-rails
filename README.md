# dropzonejs-rails

Integrate [Matias Meno's Dropzone](http://www.dropzonejs.com/) awesome file upload JS library right into the Asset pipeline of your Rails apps.

## Version

The latest version of this gem bundles **Dropzone v5.2.0**.

### Dropzone 4.x

If you depend on Dropzone's 4.x branch, you need to specify `gem 'dropzonejs-rails', '~> 0.7.4'` in your Gemfile, otherwise you'll get 5.x.

### Dropzone 3.x

If you depend on Dropzone's 3.x branch, you need to specify `gem 'dropzonejs-rails', '~> 0.5.3'` in your Gemfile, otherwise you'll get 4.x.

## Installation and usage

First add `dropzonejs-rails` to your Gemfile and, as you already know, `bundle` it and then restart your Rails app:

```ruby
# On your Gemfile
gem 'dropzonejs-rails'
```

```bash
$ bundle install
```

After that, you need to make `dropzone.js` available on your pages. To do that, you can add it to your `application.js` file, like this:

```javascript
//= require dropzone
```

And if you would like to use one of the styles bundled with Dropzone, add to your `application.css`:
```scss
*= require dropzone/basic
```
or
```scss
*= require dropzone/dropzone
```

And **Bam!** - you're all set.
